If you want to import a language into MMOItems, simply drag & drop
the contents of a language folder into the /MMOItems/language folder.
Make sure you have all the files at the end, and restart your server.

!! Some item stats use lore to store their data and thus will NO LONGER work on older items if
you change their corresponding translation in the /MMOItems/language/stats.yml file, including:
- gem stones
- custom durability

So make sure you translate them before creating items with these options!
